Backtracking - Trying all possible combinations

Q1. Rat in a maze : Given the maze and initial loc of the mouse (x,y).
	Return true if there exists a path from the start to the end.
		TC - O (N*M)
		
Q2. Rat in a maze 2 (Google)
	Given the maze and start point of rat (si, sj) end point of the hole (ei, ej) and below values to represent the cells
	blocked cells - 1, Cells filled with cheese - 0, Empty cell - can have any value
	Count the number of paths from start to end such that the rat can eat all the cheese present in the maze without stepping
	on the same cell twice in the path.
		TC for this solution would be - 4 ^ (N*M)
		Because after visiting the current entire path we are making the cells reset to their previous state
		Since we can move in four directions from every cell there are four possibilities
