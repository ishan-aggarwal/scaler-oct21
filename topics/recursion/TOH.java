//Q1. Tower of Hanoi
//Problem Description
//In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers numbered from 1 to 3 (left to right) and A disks numbered from 1 to A (top to bottom) of different sizes which can slide onto any tower.
//The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one).
//You have the following constraints:
//Only one disk can be moved at a time.
//A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
//A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
//You have to find the solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem.
//You have to return a 2D array of dimensions M x 3, where M is the minimum number of moves needed to solve the problem.
//In each row, there should be 3 integers (disk, start, end), where:
//
//disk - number of disk being moved
//start - number of the tower from which the disk is being moved
//stop - number of the tower to which the disk is being moved
//
//
//Problem Constraints
//1 <= A <= 18
//
//
//Input Format
//The first argument is the integer A.
//
//
//Output Format
//Return a 2D array with dimensions M x 3 as mentioned above in the description.
//
//
//Example Input
//Input 1:
//A = 2
//Input 2:
//
//A = 3
//
//
//Example Output
//Output 1:
//[1 1 2 ] [2 1 3 ] [1 2 3 ]
//Output 2:
//
//[1 1 3 ] [2 1 2 ] [1 3 2 ] [3 1 3 ] [1 2 1 ] [2 2 3 ] [1 1 3 ] 
//
//
//Example Explanation
//Explanation 1:
//We shift the first disk to the middle tower.
//We shift the second disk to the last tower.
//We, finally, shift the first disk from the middle tower to the last tower.
//Explanation 2:
//
//We can see that this the only unique path with minimal moves to move all disks from the first to the third tower.
